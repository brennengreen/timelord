# Timelord
Timelord is a command-line tool written in C++ that allows you to easily keep track of the amount of time you've spent working on projects.
Timelord accomplishes this by using a resource-friendly (with Virtual Machines in mind) strategy of simply recording clock in and clock out times then comparing them.

### The most important part is timelord will never be running on your computer! 
After execution there is no process left running in the background. Just run timelord start to begin tracking and timelord quit to receive and store your time for projects!
